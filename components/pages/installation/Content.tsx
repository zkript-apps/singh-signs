A raceway is a rectangular mounting structure which serves as both a container for the sign’s electrical components (such as a power supply) and a mounting structure.",
    "A wireway also serves as a mounting structure but typically contains only wiring. It is thinner and broader than a raceway, and may also be used as a backer panel for the channel letter set.",

Typically seen in exterior applications, they’re incredibly easy to install, inexpensive to purchase – and most importantly – extremely resilient and visible over great distances.",

Giving visibility to businesses both day and night, cabinet signs are known for their durability and versatility.",
    "Cabinet signs are most commonly manufactured using extruded aluminum components that are welded together, providing a strong frame for polycarbonate or impact-resistant acrylic sign faces. While many cabinet signs are rectangular, nearly any shape can be achieved, giving business owners the option to fully customize their signage in order to best attract customers. Commercial landlords appreciate the flexibility of cabinet signs with the option to replace a sign’s face for a new tenant without needing to replace the entire structure.",
